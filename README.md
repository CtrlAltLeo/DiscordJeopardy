# DiscordJeopardy
Discord Jeopardy was started in 2021 by HexZ as a way for our friend group to get together and answer funny trivia about each other, and as a break from 
playing that valorant rage game all the time. 

In 2022, Hex approached me and asked if it was possible to create a board for jeopardy for a more interactive experience. It didn't seem like too hard of a
tasque, so I decided to give it a whirl. 

Feel Free to download the source and add your own references and memes to the player, or tweak the editor to suit your needs. 

You can also download Discord Jeopardy as an applet for Windows or Linux by going to the Brimless Games site and finding the project. 

Enjoy having a fun time with the boys!
